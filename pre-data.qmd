## Research Question

- To evaluate whether the change of coach has a statistically and practically significant effect on team performance, using model-based inference and standardized metrics.

-

## Data Preparation

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

df <- readRDS("df_prepared.rds")


df_example <- df %>%
  filter(Team == "Dortmund", coach_change == 1 | lead(coach_change, 1) == 1) %>%
  select(
    Team,
    Date,
    coach,
    coach_change,
    change_index,
    change_period,
    Points,
    heterogeneity_std
  ) %>%
  head(5)

# 美化列名
names(df_example) <- c("Team", "Date", "Coach", "Change", "Change ID", "Phase", "Points", "Heterogeneity")
# 输出适应页面宽度的表格
kable(df_example, format = "latex", booktabs = TRUE, caption = "Example rows around coaching change") %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("scale_down", "hold_position"))
```

- Scraped all Bundesliga match data (2017–2025)using  the package`worldfootballR`
- 30 teams, total 4876 matches (only `ForAgainst = For` rows kept)

## Coach Change Events and Hetergeneity
Hypothesis: When is a coaching change more effective? — When the team is homogeneous.

- Identified coach change points and assigned `event_id`
- Created windows before/after the change
- Constructed:
  - `relative_time` (time index relative to change)
  - `post` (binary: pre/post change)
  - `time_post` (time since change)
$$\text{Heterogeneity}{it} = \frac{1}{3} \sum \text{SD}{i,\,t-4:t}(k), \quad k \in \{\text{Sh}, \text{SoT}, \text{xG}\}$$

where $\text{SD}_{i,\,t-4:t}(k)$ denotes the standard deviation of variable k for team i over the five-match window from t-4 to t. The variables include:
	•	$\text{Sh}$: number of shots
	•	$\text{SoT}$: shots on target
	•	$\text{xG}$: expected goals

## Visualization

- Plotted average points over time by `relative_time`
- Compared pre- and post-change trends
- Goal: visually assess changes in team performance after coaching switches

## Interrupted Time Series Model (ITS) and Poisson Regression Model
We model team performance using the following regression:
$$
y_{it} = \alpha_i + \beta_1 t + \beta_2 \cdot \text{post}_{it} + \beta_3 \cdot \text{time\_post}_{it} + \beta_4 \cdot \text{home}_{it} + \beta_5 \cdot \text{elo}_{it} + \varepsilon_{it}
$$

where $\alpha_i$ corresponds to C(Team) or heter— the fixed effect for each team.

We model count-type outcomes (e.g., goals or points) as:

$y_{it} \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_{it})$

with the log link function:
$$
\log(\lambda_{it}) = \alpha_i + \beta_1 t + \beta_2 \cdot \text{post}_{it} + \beta_3 \cdot \text{time\_post}_{it} + \beta_4 \cdot \text{home}_{it} + \beta_5 \cdot \text{elo}_{it}
$$

## Further Perspective: Tactical Efficiency

- Define `eff = GF - xG_Expected`
- If post-change `eff > 0` and significant → better tactical efficiency
- If `xG_Expected ↑` but `eff ≈ 0` → chances created but not converted
